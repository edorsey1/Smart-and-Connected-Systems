#  Wheel and Car Speed Sensor

Author: Erin Dorsey, 2019-11-08

## Summary
In this skill we built a module that used an optical encoder sensor to detect wheel speed. The optical encoder in combination with an encoder template taped to the wheel, counted the number of ticks, or times that the encoder template went from black to white. It detected this based on the difference in reflection. Then these ticks were time over a small interval to generate a speed. This speed was converted into meters per second.
