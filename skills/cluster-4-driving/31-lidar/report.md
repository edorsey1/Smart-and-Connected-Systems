#  Bringing Up the LIDAR

Author: Erin Dorsey, 2019-11-07

## Summary
In this skill we built and programmed a module for the LIDAR Lite, a sensor that works by sending out a laser signal and measuring how it is reflected back to determine distance from an object. The LIDAR sends signals to the ESP32 using I2C to measure the registers.
