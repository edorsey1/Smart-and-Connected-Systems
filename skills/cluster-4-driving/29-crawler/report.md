#  The Crawler

Author: Erin Dorsey, 2019-11-08

## Summary
Configured an Electronic Speed Control (ESC) and steering servo to control the speed and direction of the crawler. The ESC was calibarated, then the crawler cycled through its minimum and maximum backwards and forwards speeds and stopping, as well as the range of angle for wheel turn.
